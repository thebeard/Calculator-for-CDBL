# Codeable Calculator

##In the html##
- Set local currency at `<form data-default="">`
- Set currency symbol, where required on input, by using `<input data-symbol="R">`


## Using Codeable Calculator ##
- Enter **Client Budget**
- Can use two values, seperated by "-"
- Enter **My Rate**
- Can use two values, seperated by "-". ( Calculates by average between two numbers )
- All two-valued inputs can actually take more. Not a feature, but a bug :p
- All white areas can be updated to calculate and reverse calculate
- Especially to play around with Estimate vs Hours
